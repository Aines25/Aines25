Hi All ðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m Christian - A Front End Web Developer :round_pushpin: Currently based in London / Crewe, UK.

:memo: 
Having spent my entire adult life within professional sports & fitness industrys, In 2021 I taught myself to code. :man_technologist: 

Despite the challenge of balancing my current career & teaching myself to code, I am capable of using HTML, CSS / Bootstrap & Javascript (currently learning react) to create mobile responsive projects. :nerd_face::iphone:

When I'm not coding you can usually find me:

- :soccer: Playing or watching football.
- :dog:	Walking my Dog Bernie.
